# ERLANG BASE PROJECT

Tested on `Windows 10`, with `Visual Studio Code 1.16.1`, `Erlang/OTP 20 [erts-9.1]`.

`<erlang installation folder>/bin` must be added to your PATH.

Add this to your keybindings.json in VS Code if you want it to run on pressing `F5`:
 
```json
    {
        "key": "f5",
        "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask",
        "args": "run"
    }
```
